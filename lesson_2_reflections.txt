What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git folder is created in your directory. This will hold the
metadata which keeps track of the different commits you make in this folder.
No commit is created yet however.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area contains the files from the working directory that you want
to commit next. This lets you think over which files you exactly want to put in
your commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per
logical change?

By comparing the files in your staging area with the files in the
repository you can see that the changes you made are a logical next commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your
history organized? How would branches help?

Branches allow you to make a different working version of a project. If you
want to make a sequence of bigger changes and test them out, while still
keeping an original version working, it is easiest to create a separate
branch for this 'experiment'.

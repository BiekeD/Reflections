What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git folder is created in your directory. This will hold the
metadata which keeps track of the different commits you make in this folder.
No commit is created yet however.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area contains the files from the working directory that you want
to commit next. This lets you think over which files you exactly want to put in
your commit.
